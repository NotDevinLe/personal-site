            hi, i&apos;m devin — this site is part personal homepage, part lab journal.
            i document my work and thinking across competitive programming, systems
            engineering, and ai research.
          </p>

          <p>
            the writing here is where i break down problems i care about, from
            optimizing algorithms and debugging low-level systems to building
            research-grade machine learning pipelines and full-stack projects.
            it&apos;s part notebook, part lab journal, and part knowledge base.
          </p>

          <h2>what you&apos;ll find</h2>
          <ul>
            <li>competitive programming writeups, proofs, and algorithmic techniques</li>
            <li>deep dives into systems topics like emulation, memory, and performance</li>
            <li>project logs for things i&apos;m building — from emulators to ml infrastructure</li>
            <li>ai and machine learning research notes, experiments, and results</li>
            <li>engineering lessons learned from debugging and scaling real systems</li>
          </ul>

          <p>
            whether you&apos;re here for algorithms, systems, or applied ai, this site
            is meant to be a transparent look into how complex software is built and
            understood from the ground up.
